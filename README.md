## 🎓 New: Interactive Hackathon!

**Learn Azure DevOps CI/CD hands-on with our interactive hackathon!**

We've created a step-by-step, self-paced learning experience that teaches you how to build production-ready CI/CD pipelines for AI agent deployment. The hackathon automatically guides you through 6 progressive steps using Azure DevOps pipelines and work items.

### 🚀 Start the Hackathon

**[➡️ Go to the Hackathon → `ado-hackathon/`](./ado-hackathon/README.md)**

What you'll learn:
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Building CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps from scratch
- Testing and evaluation strategies
- Multi-environment deployments (dev → test → prod)
- Approval gates and production best practices
- Security testing and DevSecOps

**Perfect for:** Developers and DevOps engineers new to Azure DevOps who want hands-on experience building CI/CD pipelines.

> **Note:** This is a hackathon - you will create your own pipeline YAML files! No pre-built pipelines are provided.
